# Welcome to KTP Rho Chapter!
Kappa Theta Pi is the world's first co-educational professional technology fraternity. We work to build an active community of students with a shared interest in technology; sponsoring events aimed to provide intellectual, social, and professional resources to members. We seek to foster relationships within the local community, and with corporations; ultimately providing service and philanthropy to the local community.
